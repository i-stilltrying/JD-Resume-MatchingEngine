Work on multi-agent coordination, drift detection, and closed-loop retraining

UI / UX for Intelligent Systems
Design and prototype interfaces for interacting with autonomous agents
Build explainable, accessible UI components that visualize:
AI decisions
Uncertainty
Reasoning paths
Develop native notebook experiences blending code, data, and visualization
Conduct usability testing with humans-in-the-loop
Champion UX best practices for safety, trust, and explainability

Collaboration & Innovation
Partner with AI researchers, engineers, and data scientists
Experiment with LLM APIs, agentic workflows, and open-source frameworks
